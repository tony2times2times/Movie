Week #2: JQuery, AJAX, API OMDB challenge (solo)
================================================

[x] Use JQuery and Ajax to make a call to the OMDB (Open Movie DataBase) API. This will return a JSON that we'll then use as an object array and display on the DOM.

[x] Once you've completed that, add some basic styling and make thigns look less sterile.

[] alert the user if they left the input empty when trying to search
[] remove movies from the DOM after a search
[] instead of replacing the existing search results, append more movies to the DOM on the next search (an array sound handy for this)
[] JQuery animations for transitions
[] any other ideas you've got that you have been wanting to try output
